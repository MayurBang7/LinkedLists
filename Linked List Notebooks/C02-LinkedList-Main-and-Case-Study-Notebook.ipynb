Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In its most basic form, each node contains: data, and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. The typical operations supported on a Linked List are\n","* Traverse / Search\n","* Insert an element\n","* Update an element\n","* Delete an element\n","Apart from these, we can sort a linked list, merge linked list etc.\n","\n","The principal benefit of a linked list over a conventional array is that the list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure because the data items need not be stored contiguously in memory or on disk, while restructuring an array at run-time is a much more expensive operation. Linked lists allow insertion and removal of nodes at any point in the list, and allow doing so with a constant number of operations by keeping the link previous to the link being added or removed in memory during list traversal.\n","On the other hand, since simple linked lists by themselves do not allow random access to the data or any form of efficient indexing, many basic operations—such as obtaining the last node of the list, finding a node that contains a given datum, or locating the place where a new node should be inserted—may require iterating through most or all of the list elements."],"id":"5Bf2I_ESE5Kj"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vuV0TtulE5Kk"},"source":["### <font color='blue'> Ecommerce application example </font>"],"id":"vuV0TtulE5Kk"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Jm3NF9pwE5Kk"},"source":["Consider a requirement to manage insertion to, lookup from, updates to, and deletes of Product lists in an eCommerce Portal database.

growable array, resizable array, dynamic table, mutable array, or array list is a random access, variable-size list data structure that allows elements to be added or removed. It is supplied with standard libraries in many modern mainstream programming languages. Dynamic arrays overcome a limit of static arrays, which have a fixed capacity that needs to be specified at allocation.\n","\n","A dynamic array is not the same thing as a dynamically allocated array, which is an array whose size is fixed when the array is allocated, although a dynamic array may use such a fixed-size array as a back end.\n","\n","A simple dynamic array can be constructed by allocating an array of fixed-size, typically larger than the number of elements immediately required. The elements of the dynamic array are stored contiguously at the start of the underlying array, and the remaining positions towards the end of the underlying array are reserved, or unused. Elements can be added at the end of a dynamic array in constant time by using the reserved space, until this space is completely consumed. When all space is consumed, and an additional element is to be added, then the underlying fixed-size array needs to be increased in size. Typically resizing is expensive because it involves allocating a new underlying array and copying each element from the original array. Elements can be removed from the end of a dynamic array in constant time, as no resizing is required. The number of elements used by the dynamic array contents is its logical size or size, while the size of the underlying array is called the dynamic array's capacity or physical size, which is the maximum possible size without relocating data\n","\n","Dynamic arrays benefit from many of the advantages of arrays, including good locality of reference and data cache utilization, compactness (low memory use), and random access. They usually have only a small fixed additional overhead for storing information about the size and capacity. This makes dynamic arrays an attractive tool for building cache-friendly data structures.\n","\n","__Python's list datatype implementation is a dynamic array.__"],"id":"1vHEgJAmE5Kv"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ovECjso9E5Kv"},"source":["#### References\n","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list#Circular_linked_list\n","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_array"],"id":"ovECjso9E5Kv"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7YO6ylCmE5Kv"},"source":["\n"],"id":"7YO6ylCmE5Kv"}]}
